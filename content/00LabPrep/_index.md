## Objective

The objective of this lab guide is to teach you one of many methods for running an SD-WAN POC with FortiManager + ZTP.  There are many different DC designs. The intention of this lab is not to cover all designs (there are other existing  environments that provide this already). This lab will differ from previous labs in that the focus will be to show how to use the SD-WAN Overlay Template generator for the majority of the configuration on a FMG-LAB. You will then export the configurations from the FMG-LAB and learn how to import into a customer FMG-POC.

Much of this labâ€™s configuration will be similar to the existing SD-WAN Evoke 7.0 training lab and can be used as a starting place for most POCs.
